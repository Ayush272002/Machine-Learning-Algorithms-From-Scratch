# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch, organized into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforced learning. The algorithms are implemented in Python, without relying on external libraries for the core functionality.

**Installation:** To install the required dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
